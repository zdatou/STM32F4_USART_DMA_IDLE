RELEASE_NOTES for PTPd V2 ()

v2rc1, January 2010:

This is the first public source code release of PTPd implementing PTP v2 as
defined by 'IEEE Std 1588-2008'.
The source has been derivated from ptpd v1.0.0, compiled with gcc and tested 
on x86 platforms connected on an Ethernet infrastructure using a Hirschman 1588v2
compliant Ethernet switch configured in Transparent Clock mode.
(http://www.hirschmann.com/en/).

This implementation supports both E2E and P2P mode with an ordinary clock on 
master/slave end-points.
It support the 802.1 AS profile (http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1as.html)

Please, have a look on the short comparison document 'IEEE1588v1_vs_IEEE1588v2.pdf' 
in the 'Doc' subdirectory, for a overview of the main differences between the two 
versions of the IEEE1588 standard and the impact on the implementation.
